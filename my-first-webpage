            <p>
              I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Isand with my small
              growing family.  My journey into tech started with a degree in
              journalism.  As I started sharing my writing online, I was
              fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there.  I was
              hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own
              specific needs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>
              That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut.
              When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found
              something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking
              for in my work.  Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end
              development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for
              detail to write clean, elegant code.

              My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand

              I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.
              I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a
              habit to stay up to date on current best practices.
